				<p > <h1><b>HOW TO PLAY KEYBOARD FOR BEGINNERS</b></h1> 
					<h3><i>11 Tips To Learn Keyboard</i></h3>

					<p id="size">Learning the keyboard is a great foundation for learning other instruments in the future. Because of this, it's the perfect first
					instrument for kids and adults alike. The below guide is suitable for all ages, and will teach you how to properly position yourself when playing,
					the musical alphabet so you are comfortable finding your way around the keyboard, and a load of other"</p>
					
					<h4><b>1: Buy A Keyboard Bench</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> To begin, you will need a keyboard bench. It is important that you use a bench and not a chair, as using a bench allows for proper
					posture which will alleviate any aches or stress on your muscles. For a child you may have to add cushions to a bench, or buy an adjustable bench
					so they can reach the keyboard comfortably.This comes with the caveat that you still need to use proper posture while playing (i.e. no slouching).
					Even the best bench can't make you do what you aren't willing to do yourself. If possible, work with a qualified instructor to find the proper
					height and position, especially if it's for kids.</p>
					
					<h4><b>2: Positioning Yourself To Play Keyboard</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> Sitting on the front half of the bench will allow you to move freely. This will also create the correct distance from the keyboard.
					Place your feet flat on the floor, remembering that only a small portion of your knees should be under the keyboard. This should give you the right
					distance to play comfortably. It may take a while to adjust to this positioning, but keep practicing as it will give you the best posture for playing.
					General best practice is to sit at around middle C (you'll find a more detailed explanation a little later). Depending on your keyboard, there will
					either be fewer keys, or more keys, but finding the middle C should be relatively easy to do. We'll talk more about the musical alphabet in a moment.</p>
					
					<h4><b>3 &amp; 4: How To Position Your Hands And Arms While Playing The Keyboard</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> To position your hands, start by letting your arms hang to your side. Naturally, your hand will form a "C" shape. Maintain this natural
					cupped shape while keeping the hands relaxed.Keeping this C shaped hand position, place your hands on the keyboard in front of you. Be sure to keep your
					wrists straight as well as your forearms. If you are not playing notes immediately in front of you, lean your body in the direction that your hands are
					playing to avoid twisting the wrist. Hand positioning is critically important, and will help you reduce the risk of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel
					syndrome, and so on. Beware of overplaying, especially when you're first getting started, and check often to make sure you're keeping your forearms and
					wrists straight as you practice the keyboard.</p>
					
					<h4><b>5: Get The Correct Body Position</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> It is important to maintain good posture while playing the keyboard and to sit tall. Lift your shoulders up to your ears, and then let
					them fall. Keep the shoulders relaxed. If you are too stiff, you will find that your muscles will feel strained when playing, and no one wants that.
					Although your tendency might be to tense up as you play (particularly when you're playing a difficult passage of music), instrumentalists rarely play
					at their best when they are rigid and taut. Learn to relax. Your elbows should be at approximately the same height as the keys. Sit at the middle of
					the keyboard, which is around notes E or F, and above middle C. If you aren't sure of where the notes are yet, don't worry. We'll show you how to find
					them below.</p>
				
					<h4><b>6: Using The Black Keys As Guidance</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> In order to understand where each note is on the keyboard, you need to know that there is a "seven note musical alphabet". This consists
					of the notes A, B, C, D, E, F and G, using white keys only. After the note G, the alphabet begins all over again.</p>
					
					<h4><b>7: How To Find The Groups On A Keyboard</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> Now, you might be wondering what the black keys are for. Our focus right now is the white keys, which are also known as "natural notes",
					so there's no need to memorize what notes the black keys are just yet. But these are not minor notes as some people think, and they aren't "bad" sounding
					notes either. You could call them "accidental notes". When played in the right context, they are just as effective as the white keys, though they sometimes
					provide a challenge in terms of reaching them and incorporating them in your playing.</p>
					
					<h4><b>8: How To Find Note C Off By Heart</b></h4> 
					<p id="size">C is always the white key to the left of a group of two black keys. Each C is an octave (eight notes) apart. I advise you play each C on the
					keyboard and get a feel for the positioning and the distance. We talked about how there are only seven notes in the musical alphabet. So, what this means 
					is that, if you start on A, and you play to G (like in the above image), the note following that will be A again. In this way, notes keep repeating up
					(and down) the keyboard. So, finding all the Cs on the keyboard shouldn't be too hard, you just have to look for the patterns. As I mentioned, C is the
					white key on the left of two black keys, no matter where you are on the keyboard.</p>
					
					<h4><b>9: How To Find Note F</b></h4> 
					<p id="size">Okay, here's one final tip before you're ready to start playing the keyboard. As with the C note, it's important you learn the F note. The
					positioning is relatively easy to remember, as the note F is always before a group of three black keys. Find and play each F note on the keyboard to become
					familiar with it. As with the C note, each F is an octave apart (meaning seven notes above or below). In this way, you can continue to memorize the positions
					of the entire musical alphabet. If you want to earn extra points at this stage, try finding all the As, Bs, Ds, Es, and Gs, on the keyboard as well. You
					don't need to do this before moving onto the next step, but it's fun and easy to do. Give it a try, and test your knowledge.</p>
					
					<h4><b>10: Whole Notes, Half Notes &amp; Quarter Notes</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> Piano music is written in standard musical notation, which consists of five lines. You don't need to know what these lines represent just yet.
					But one thing you should learn at this stage is what whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes are. First, have a look at the above image. You can see how
					a whole note, half note, and quarter note all look a little different when written out in notation. The whole note is a dot with an empty middle. A half note
					is like a whole note with an arm stretching upwards. A quarter note is a half note except with a filled (black) dot. Now that you can see the difference 
					between each, let's explore how they work.</p>
					
					<h4><b>11: Your First Exercise</b></h4> 
					<p id="size"> In this exercise, you're going to be using your thumb, index finger, and middle finger to play C, D, and E. By now you should know that all
					these notes are side by side. The first note is C, the white key next to it is D, and the white key following that is E.Starting at middle C, play C with
					your right-hand thumb, D with your index finger, and E with your middle finger. Try that a few times, and once you've gotten the hang of it, try it at different
					positions (octaves) on the keyboard. Remember, whenever practicing an exercise like this, start slowly. You don't want to strain your hand or fingers, and slowing
					things down will give you more control.</p>
