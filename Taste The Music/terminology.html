		<img src="style/number3.png" class="img-things">
		<p class="links"><i>"Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand." ~ Stevie Wonder</i></br>
		So to help you get started with this new language, here is a list of essential drums vocabulary.</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">DRUMS</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>The bass drum is the large drum at the bottom of the drum kit and has a low pitch. It is played with a pedal.</li>
				<li>The snare drum goes between the drummers legs and is most commonly 14 inches in diameter. Wires on the bottom
				drum head produce a "buzzing" sound when the drum is played.</li>
				<li>The high tom is placed above and in front of the snare drum and usually mounted on the bass drum. It is the 
				highest-pitched of the tom toms and makes a round open, resonant sound.</li>
				<li>Like the high tom, the mid tom is usually mounted on the bass drum. It is placed next to the high tom and has
				a similar sound but is tuned to a lower pitch.</li>
				<li>The low tom (floor tom) is the lowest-pitched of the tom toms. It is usually deeper than the high and mid toms 
				and most commonly features legs; therefore, it doesn't need to be mounted to a stand or another drum. A low tom with
				legs is called a floor tom.</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">CYMBALS</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>The hi hat cymbals are a pair of medium-sized cymbals that are held together on a hi hat stand. By releasing the
				foot pedal on the hi hat stand, the cymbals separate and produce a sustained sloshy sound. The hi hats are placed next
				to the snare drum and the pedal is played with the weak foot.</li>
				<li>The ride cymbal is a large cymbal that is usually placed next to the floor tom at the right-hand side of the kit 
				(for right-handed players). It is most commonly played with the tip of the stick on the surface of the cymbal to produce
				a "ding" sound.</li>
				<li>The crash cymbal varies from 14 to 20 inches in diameter. It is struck with the neck of the stick on the edge of the
				cymbal to produce a loud, fast "crash." Crash cymbals are usually thinner than ride cymbals, as they are designed to have
				a quick response after being hit.</li>
				<li>The splash cymbal is a small cymbal (6"-12" in diameter) that is played in a similar way to a crash. It has a very fast
				response and a fast decay.</li>
				<li>The China cymbal is an effects cymbal which produces a harsh trashy sound. It is unusual in that it bends one way, and
				then the other</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">HARDWARE</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>Floor tom legs elevate the floor tom.</li>
				<li>The bass drum pedal is used to strike the bass drum.</li>
				<li>A snare stand is a stand for the snare drum.</li>
				<li>The tom arm is usually placed in a hole in the bass drum. These tom stands are designed to mount the tom toms but 
				allow them to resonate freely.</li>
				<li>A hi hat stand features a pedal which is used to bring the hi hat cymbals closer together to produce a tight sound,
				or further apart to produce a sloshy sound.</li>
				<li>A cymbal stand is designed to hold a cymbal.</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">MAINTENANCE</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>A drum key is for tuning drums.</li>
				<li>Rings of felt are placed on cymbal stands to protect cymbals from damage.</li>
				<li>Sleeves are plastic tubings placed on the cymbal stand to protect cymbals from damage.</li>
				<li>The wing nuts are used to seal cymbals onto their stands.</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">DRUM HEADS</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>The drum head, otherwise known as “drum skin,” is a thin sheet of plastic film that covers the drum and is struck to 
				produce the sound we hear.</li>
				<li>Clear drum heads are transparent and have a resonant tone.</li>
				<li>Coated drum heads have a white frosted coating, which gives them a dryer, warmer tone.</li>
				<li>Calf skin heads are designed to look and feel like real calfskin heads.</li>
				<li>The batter head refers to the drum head on the side of the drum which is struck.</li>
				<li>The resonant head refers to the side of the drum which isn't struck.</li>
				<li>Single ply heads feature one thin ply of film. They are less durable but have a brighter sound.</li>
				<li>Double ply heads feature two plies of plastic film and produce a darker, more dampened sound.</li>
				<li>The snare head is the drumhead placed on the bottom of the snare. It is an extremely thin head designed to get optimum response from
				the snares.</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">DRUM ANATOMY</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>The drum shell is the main body of the drum and is usually made of wood.</li>
				<li>The drum shell is the main body of the drum and is usually made of wood.</li>
				<li>Lugs are small inserts on the outside of the shell into which tension rods are screwed.</li>
				<li>The tension rods are placed through holes in the hoop and are screwed into the lugs to create the desired drum head tension.</li>
				<li>Snares are coiled wires on the bottom of a snare drum, which rest on the snare head. When the drum is hit, the snares rattle producing a "buzzing" sound.</li>
				<li>The throw off or throw is used to release the snares from the snare head and transform the snare drum into a regular drum.</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="second-title">RHYTHM</h1>
		<p class="links">
			<ul class="more">
				<li>The backbeats are beats 2 and 4 of each bar. Most pop and rock music features a heavy accent on the backbeats, giving the music its momentum.</li>
				<li>Down beats are notes played on the pulse.</li>
				<li>Up beats are notes played against the pulse.</li>
				<li>Time signature tells us the number of beats in each bar and the type of beats they are. 4/4 tells us that there are 4 quarter beats in each bar.</li>
				<li>Bars are how music is measured. Breaking music down into bars allows players and listeners to more easily navigate.</li>
				<li>The beat is another measurement of music. If bars are equivalent to a pound when referring to weight, then beats can be compared to ounces. A bar is made up of a certain number of beats, and a beat can
				be subdivided further.</li>
				<li>A quarter note (crotchet) represents a quarter of a whole note. Most music has a quarter note pulse, so these notes are often defined as one beat in length.</li>
				<li>The duration of an eighth note (quaver) is an eighth of a whole note. In most pop and rock music, an eighth note is half a beat in length (the beats are usually quarter notes in length).</li>
				<li>A sixteenth note (semiquaver) has the value of a sixteenth of a whole note.</li>
				<li>A half note (minim) has the value of half a whole note or 2 quarter note beats.</li>
				<li>A whole note has the value of 4 quarter note beats.</li>
			</ul>
