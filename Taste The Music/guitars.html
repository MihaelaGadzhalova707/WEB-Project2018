				<p > <h1><b>HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT GUITAR?</b></h1> 
					<h3><i>First things first: Which kind of guitar is for you?</i></h3>
					<p id="size"> Knowing how to choose the right guitar is no joke: that baby will pretty much make or break your guitar-playing game.
					Not to put too much pressure on your string purchase. Your first instrument will determine how effectively you will be able to practice
					and learn your first few songs, chords, techniques and styles. Depending on your choice, it can make your first few months (or years) a
					hard-earned joy, or an unnecessarily difficult and unnecessarily painful experience.</p>
					<p id="size"> Do you like the powerful, raw twangs of the electric guitar? Or do you want to keep it fresh and chill with the melodic rhythms
					from an acoustic? Do you enjoy listening to the creative and funky tunes of blues? The superb sounds of progressive rock? The unmistakable intensity
					of metal? You will have a less painful choice to make if you're set on the genre you love listening to. Why? What you groove (or headbang) to is
					most likely what you'll want to play with your guitar. You'll be motivated to practice and train more if you love what you're doing.</p>
					<p id="size"> <span id="color-span"><b><i>Most importantly, only select a guitar you know is fully inspected and adjusted for easy playability, accuracy in
					tuning, intonation and tone production. </i></b></span>
					<h4 style="padding-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 1px"><b>1. Strings </b></h4>
				<div class="w3-content w3-section" style="max-width:500px">
					<img class="mySlides" src="style/crew.png" style="width:100%">
					<img class="mySlides" src="style/crew1.png" style="width:100%">
					<img class="mySlides" src="style/crew2.png" style="width:100%">

				<script>
					var myIndex = 0;
					carousel();

					function carousel() {
						var i;
						var x = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
						for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
							x[i].style.display = "none";  
						}
						myIndex++;
						if (myIndex > x.length) {myIndex = 1}    
						x[myIndex-1].style.display = "block";

					<p id="size">
					You have two options with acoustic guitars: <u>nylon and steel strings</u>. The first option is less abrasive to the fingers, and produce a more mellow, chill
					sound (which makes it easier on the neighbor's ears, too). Very John Williams. Steel strings on the other hand, have a more solid tune that sounds just
					as great, if you're looking to be the next Jason Mraz. While a lot may recommend nylon strings for your novice playing, it's not really about getting your
					callouses ready for steel. The two cannot be interchanged in the same guitar, so make sure that your decision is based on the sound that you prefer, and not
					for fear of nicks and ouchies.</p>
					<h4 style="padding-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 1px"><b>2. Size </b></h4>
					<p id="size"> The body of a classical acoustic guitar The body of a classical acoustic guitar greatly influences its tone and volume. Larger guitars have
					a rounder sound that gives off major bass. Smaller pieces tend to highlight treble tones and sound somewhat brighter. Acoustic guitars are generally larger
					in size compared to electric ones, making it a more challenging option for the petite player. Don't let YOUR size discourage you from snatching a classical,
					though. With practice and some adjustment, you can master the instrument regardless of your stature.</p>
					<h4 style="padding-bottom: 1px; padding-top: 1px"><b>3. Wood </b></h4>
					<p id="size">Price dictates the material of your guitar, so try not to skimp on the budget. Cheaper acoustic guitars have multi-layered wood with laminates
					to give off a “solid wood” look. If done well, it can look just as great as solid wood guitars. As a beginner you may not notice much difference, but solid
					wood guitars produce a more pleasing sound. But hey, if you're looking for a starter instrument that you can eventually upgrade, laminated tops won't be as
					bad.</p>
